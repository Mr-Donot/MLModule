# Deep Learning Module with Numpy

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

This repository contains a deep learning module implemented in Python using only the NumPy library. The module includes a neural network that is designed and implemented from scratch.

## Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: The repository includes a customizable neural network.

- **Activation Functions**: I only use the sigmoid function for now as activation function.

- **Optimizers**: I use the gradient descent in back-propagation to teach to my model.

- **Data Preprocessing**: CSV files are readable for some formats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pickle
Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
